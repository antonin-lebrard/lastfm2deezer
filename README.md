# Import lastfm listenning habits into deezer

<b>Work in progress, not done at the moment</b>

Fetch all albums, and all artists listenned to from lastfm, and 'likes' them on their respective equivalent on deezer.

This is for helping people like myself to have a cool deezer.com/feed filled with all the news from the artists we have listenned 
on the past, without the struggle to like them one by one.

Cool for newcomers, or maybe recently switched on deezer type of peoples.
